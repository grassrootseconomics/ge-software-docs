## Overview

The Custodial Stack allows any non-web3 client to interact with smart contracts on any EVM chain. Such clients may include:

* USSD
* Telegram bots
* Websites
* Anything that talks HTTP

Below is a high level overview of how different components interact and make up the custodial stack:

### Prerequisites

The following are required in preparation of running the custodial stack:

#### Minimum system requirements

* Stable internet connection
* Access to an Ethereum/EVM node with RPC and websockets enabled
* Atleast 2 GB of RAM (Approximate)

To self-host an entire custodial setup in production, we recommend:

1. Custodial Stack Backend: 16 GB RAM, 8 vCPU with atleast 50 GB SSD storage. This roughly costs anywhere between $40 - $100 a month depending on your preffered cloud provider. This VM would run the enitre backend stack on a single docker host. It should comfortably accomodate ~ 10k daily active users.
2. RPC full node: 32 GB RAM, 16 CPU with atleast 2 TB SSD Storage. This rougly costs anywhere between $120 - $200. We recommend obtaining a baremetal server to run this. This VM would run the Celo blockchain stack. It is possible to replace this with a 3rd party RPC provider like dRPC or Ankr.

Please reach out to the tech team to discuss your requirements in more details.

### Chain requirements

* 1 Ether to setup the smart contracts
* EVM hardfork minimal requirement: Istanbul
* Instant finality recommended (no chance of block reorgs)
