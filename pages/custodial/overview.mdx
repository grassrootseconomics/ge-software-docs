## Overview

The Custodial Stack allows any non-web3 client to interact with smart contracts on any EVM chain. Such clients may include:

* USSD
* Telegram bots
* Websites
* Anything that talks HTTP

Below is a high level overview of how different components interact and make up the custodial stack:

### Prerequisites

The following are required in preparation of running the custodial stack:

#### Minimum system requirements

* Stable internet connection
* Access to an Ethereum/EVM node with RPC and websockets enabled
* Atleast 2 GB of RAM (Approximate)

### Chain requirements

* 1 Ether to setup the smart contracts
* EVM hardfork minimal requirement: Istanbul
* Instant finality recommended (no chance of block reorgs)

### Self-hosted budget guideline

This is a guide to approximate the monthly costs of completely self-hosting the custodial stack + other components listed here on a cloud provider for a small deployment which can support upto 10k active users. 

#### Custodial Backend Stack Server

This hosts all backend services and databases.

Estimate: $40 - $100 (Depending on your choosen cloud provider).
Recommended Specs: 16 GB RAM, 8 vCPU with atleast 50 GB SSD storage.

#### Blockchain RPC Server (Baremetal)

This hosts the CELO RPC node and is future proofed for 1 year. We recommend using a provider which supports storage upgrades.

Estimate: $120 - $250 (Depending on your choosen baremetal provider).
Recommended Specs: 32 GB RAM, 16 CPU with atleast 2 TB SSD storage.

It is possible to use 3rd party RPC providers like dRPC and Ankr or completely free public RPC nodes like Forno, however, we do not recommend this.

#### AfricasTalking Subscription

This is required for those who want to run the USSD service within Africa. Please refer to https://africastalking.com/pricing for more details.

One-time setup costs estimate: $70 - $100 (SMS ID)
Monthy subscription for shared USSD code: $190

Varying costs depending on AU (active users). If a user were to do 5 transfers daily, it would cost:

USSD: 5 * 45 UGX * 5 (2 min session) =  1125 UGX
SMS: 25 UGX * 5 * 2 (SMS sent to sender and recipient) = 250 UGX

~ 1500 UGX per active user daily.

#### CELO Gas Costs requirements

Assuming there are ~500 daily transactions and you would like to sponsor all the gas costs.

Estimate: < 2.5 CELO/Daily
