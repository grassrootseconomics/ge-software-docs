# Introduction

We provide a low latency globally loadbalanced Celo RPC infrastructure with generous features for developers and users of the Celo network.

* Add `https://celo.sarafu.africa` as a Celo RPC endpoint in your wallet or application to use our infrastructure.
* For WebSocket connections, use `wss://ws-celo.sarafu.africa`.

## Dashboard

Visit https://rpc.sarafu.africa for the RPC Dashboard (TBD).
