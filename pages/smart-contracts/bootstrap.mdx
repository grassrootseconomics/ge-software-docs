# Custodial System Bootstrap

Grassroots Economics provides a script to quickly deploy all core contracts + a sample Demurrage voucher contract that can be used for training purposes. The default values can be overridden.

## Setup

## Prerequistes

* `ge-publish` (https://github.com/grassrootseconomics/ge-publish)
* `cast` (https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)
* Access to an Ethereum node
* Atleast 1 ETH

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Some flags have been omitted, refer to both ge-publish and cast "help" for required flags.
</Callout>

### Steps

1. Publish a token index:

```bash
ge-publish p token-index
```


2. Publish a user index:

```bash
ge-publish p user-index
```

3. Publish a gas faucet:

```bash
ge-publish p faucet
```

4. Publish a period backend for the gas faucet:

```bash
ge-publish p period
```

5. Setup the period backend:

```bash
# Set the gas faucet as the poker with setPoker(address)
cast send $PERIOD_BACKEND "setPoker(address)" $GAS_FAUCET
# Set the cooldown period after which a user may request for gas again with setPeriod(uint256) [86400=24hrs]
cast send $PERIOD_BACKEND "setPeriod(uint256)" 86400
# Set the balance threshold such that a user can only request for more gas if their balance is less than the threshold at that time
# 0.03 CELO ~= 5 token transfers in the worse network conditions ~= 2 KES [30000000000000000]
cast send $PERIOD_BACKEND "setBalanceThreshold(uint256)" 30000000000000000
```

6. Setup the gas faucet

```bash
# Set the top up amount: 0.03 CELO ~= 5 token transfers in the worse network conditions ~= 2 KES [30000000000000000]
cast send $GAS_FAUCET "setAmount(uint256)" 30000000000000000
# Set the period checker pointing it to the period backend
cast send $GAS_FAUCET "setPeriodChecker(address)" $PERIOD_BACKEND
# Set the user index on the gas faucet (This acts as an ACL)
cast send $GAS_FAUCET "setRegistry(address)" $USER_INDEX
# Top up the faucet. This should be done regularly.
cast send --value 10ether $GAS_FAUCET
```

7. Publish a custodial registration proxy

* Remember to reset the system account address after setting up the eth-custodial backend.

```bash
# We pass a place holder value i.e your public key as the initial system account address
# We will replace this value later
ge-publish p custodial --faucet $GAS_FAUCET --user-index $USER_INDEX --system-account-address $YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY
```

8. Setup user index

```bash
# Add the custodial registration proxy as a writer to the user index
cast send $USER_INDEX "addWriter(address)" $CUSTODIAL_REGISTRATION_PROXY
```

9. Publish a  pools index

```bash
# A pool index is usually the same as a token index
ge-publish p token-index
```

10. Publish a contracts registry

This is the entry point to discover all other contracts.

```bash
ge-publish p registry --identifier AccountIndex --identifier CustodialRegistrationProxy --identifier GasFaucet --identifier TokenIndex --identifier PoolIndex
```

11. Setup the contracts registry

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  The commented string2bytes32 are fixed. You can use them as your first argument to the set call.
</Callout>

```bash
# string to bytes32 identifiers
# cast format-bytes32-string [STRING]
# CustodialRegistrationProxy=0x437573746f6469616c526567697374726174696f6e50726f7879000000000000

cast send $REGISTRY "set(bytes32,address)" 0x437573746f6469616c526567697374726174696f6e50726f7879000000000000 $CUSTODIAL_REGISTRATION_PROXY

```

12. (Optional) Add a writer to any of the published indexes

```bash
# Add a writer to the token index
cast send  $TOKEN_INDEX "addWriter(address)" $YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY
```


13. (Optional) Publish some tokens and add them to the tokens index

```bash
# Publish a standard ERC20
ge-publish p erc20--name "Kilifi" --symbol "KILIFI"
cast send $TOKEN "mintTo(address,uint256)" $YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY 100000000
cast send $TOKEN_INDEX "add(address)" $TOKEN
```

14. (Optional) To deploy a pool, refer to:

15. Set up custodial registration proxy

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  The system account can be dumped via the ETH custodial API using the /system endpoint
</Callout>

```bash
# Top up the system account
cast send --value 10ether $SYSTEM_ACCOUNT
# Set the new system account on the custodial registration proxy
cast send $CUSTODIAL_REGISTRATION_PROXY "setNewSystemAccount(address)" $SYSTEM_ACCOUNT
```
